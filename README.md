# Real-Time Face Detection with OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier. The application captures live video from your webcam, detects faces in each frame, and highlights them with bounding boxes.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Detects faces in live video feed from your webcam.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier:** Uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.
- **Live Visualization:** Displays video with detected faces highlighted by bounding boxes.
- **User Control:** Exit the application by pressing 'q'.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2` module)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/surajsharma68/Face-Detection-System
